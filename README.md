# Nature Of Project: 
The purpose of the project it display my method for coding in HTML and CSS and bringing basic projects to life. The best way to describe the way i code, is to keep things simple. I feel that because you can do so much with a div element in html and as long as you know how to control it's properties with CSS you're able to make it seem as if your using a header element or paragraph element with the use of a div. In addition i know in my project i used text inside div's i will describe in detail how i got text to work inside some of the divs. and how i used css to change text properties.  

1. div id="namePlaqueBackground" - I created this container using a div html and with the Id attribute. I decided to go this route in designing my container element, mainly becuase div elements are designed for being containers. Becuase Id's can do so much more things id's designing with css very simple and straight forward. 

2. div id="title" - because my experience with HTML and CSS decided to design my title with a div because i understand how to control the properties in css and make it appear as if you were using any of the 6 header elements that are currently present in html today. 

3. div id="enterName">Enter Name: - once again im pretty much doing the same with this div element like in example no.2

4.input type="text" id="fullName" placeholder="Enter Your Name Here" - for this section of the code i decided to use input type text to create a text box where you could type text too. with css i was able to enlarge it change the font-color, size, and family. what you can also do with a input type text is with js youre able to collect data that is typed inside of it and use it to post messages or for instance in my case because the project a cost per letter. 

5. div id="btn">Show Cost</div - this is a button that is created using a div. Like have mentioned in the past because i got so used to designing in html with div i am able to create just about any element in html with the use of a div. In order for me to create the a button with a dive element i had to assign once again an attribute called an id. I gave it the value of btn so that in css i could access it with #btn. To add text to the button its quite simple just like in a paragraph element where you type text inside the element you do the same with the div element i called btn. next in css you use text-align: center and line-height: 30px to center the text in middle of the div. I also used #btn:active to give the button a cool clicking sensation very similar to the button element in html. With btn active your able to add a border to your button so that everytime the button is clicked it give it that press down feeling you look for in buttons. without using btn:active you pretty much stil have a button that works but you wont have that neat press down feel that active gives you.  

# Add-ons:
- add JS to make btn clickable and able to capture and print cost for you. 
- add JS event handler to make the enter keyboard button accessible with JS to capture name and return cost. 
- add another div with nested div's with ids which return cost and a messages but coded with JS.
